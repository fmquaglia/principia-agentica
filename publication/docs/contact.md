# Start a Conversation

Thank you for your interest in Principia Agentica. I believe the best work happens through collaboration and open
dialogue. Here are the best ways to connect.

## For Professional Inquiries

I am always open to discussing opportunities that align with the mission of this project. I would be delighted to hear
from you regarding:

* **Consulting opportunities** on AI agent architecture and strategy.
* **Invitations to speak** at conferences or on podcasts.
* **Feedback or suggestions** for the research published here.

For these matters, please feel free to reach out directly via email:

**[hello@fabricio.cloud](mailto:hello@fabricio.cloud)** or connect on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matiasquaglia/)**

## For Technical Questions & Community Discussion

The spirit of this project is to learn and build in public. If you have a technical question, a suggestion for a code
improvement, or want to discuss a specific pattern or framework, I strongly encourage you to do so on our GitHub
repository.

This ensures that the conversation and the knowledge are shared with the entire community.

* **[Open an Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/fmquaglia/principia-agentica/issues)**
* **[Start a Discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/fmquaglia/principia-agentica/discussions)**

I look forward to hearing from you and building the future of AI together.
