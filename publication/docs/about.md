# The Story of the Lighthouse

## About Principia Agentica

Building AI agents today feels like navigating a stormy sea at night. New frameworks appear like fleeting lights on the
horizon, documentation can be as foggy as a sea mist, and the risk of running aground on a complex, unmaintainable
architecture is very real.

**Principia Agentica was built to be a lighthouse.**

This project is a dedicated space for deep, practical, and honest exploration into the architectural patterns of AI
agents. Our mission is guided by a few core philosophies:

* **We "Sell Shovels":** In the AI gold rush, we focus on creating the best tools—the knowledge, comparisons, and
  code—to empower the builders.
* **We Are a Lighthouse, Not a Salesperson:** We illuminate the path by sharing knowledge generously. Authority is
  earned through clarity and evidence.
* **We Test for the "Day 100":** We believe the true test of an architecture is not its initial elegance, but its
  long-term resilience to change.

## About the Architect

![Fabricio Q](assets/avatar.png){align=left width="200"}I'm Fabricio Q., an AI Systems & Agent Specialist. My journey in software has always been driven by a passion for
architecture—the art of building systems that are not only functional but also elegant, robust, and a pleasure to work
with.

After years of designing complex software systems, I've turned my full attention to the new frontier of AI agents. I
created Principia Agentica as my public laboratory, a place to deconstruct the hype and uncover the foundational
principles (`principia`) of good agentic design.

My approach is that of a humble craftsman and a curious explorer. I believe in learning in public, giving credit to the
community, and always prioritizing the "why" behind the "how".
